## about this project
I've made next project for training-YouCode. This is a currency calculator.This page is in polish language. I put background img and background color.
This is working by js ``` 
    const sum = sumElement.value;
    const currency = currencyElement.value;
    const result= sum * currency;
    resultElement.innerText = result; ```
